# Build Singularity Container

The script `build-container.sh` is designed to build an apptainer
`.sif` file on any [Courant Compute
Server](https://cims.nyu.edu/dynamic/systems/resources/computeservers/)
using Vagrant and VirtualBox. Look for a system with plenty of space
in the `/scratch` directory.

To use, run `bash build-container.sh` from this directory.
